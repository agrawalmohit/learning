 * application context. <br>
 * {@link EnableAutoConfiguration} tells Spring Boot to start adding beans based
 * on classpath settings, other beans, and various property settings. <br>
 * Normally you would add {@link EnableWebMvc} for a Spring MVC app, but Spring
 * Boot adds it automatically when it sees spring-webmvc on the classpath. This
 * flags the application as a web application and activates key behaviors such
 * as setting up a DispatcherServlet. <br>
 * {@link ComponentScan} tells Spring to look for other components,
 * configurations, and services in the org.test package, allowing it to find the
 * controllers.
